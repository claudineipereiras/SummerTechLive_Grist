# SummerTechLive_Grist
This is a demonstration of the solution used for the Summer Tech Live I have worked using Web Solution Grist and Make integration for a client.
The files contain a data set from accident events for student purposes. The real client information was not been used for privacy purposes.

You are free to learn with a straight forward document showing how to create an account, a file and work with visualisations.

## Step by Step
It is a straight forward PDF document to teach you how to use the basics of the Web Platform.
